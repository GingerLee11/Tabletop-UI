<p>You have travelled much of the known world and perhaps parts beyond. Add each of the following to the Neighbors list in the Stonetop playbook, choosing 1 trait for each:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ennis</strong>(from Marshedge)</li>
    <li><strong>Shahar</strong>(from Gordin's Delve)</li>
    <li><strong>Yannic</strong>(from the Hillfolk)</li>
    <li><strong>Tovia</strong>(from Lygos)</li>
    <li><strong>Sasca</strong>(from northern Manmarch)</li>
</ul>

<p>You start with the Mental Map move. Mark it now.</p>

<p>When you <em><strong>Know Things about the wider world</strong></em>, you can roll +WIS instead of +INT.</p>

<p>When you <em><strong>arrive somewhere you&rsquo;ve visited before </strong></em>(your call), tell the GM when you were last here, and the GM will tell you how it&rsquo;s changed.</p>
