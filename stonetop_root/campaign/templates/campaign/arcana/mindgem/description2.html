<p>When you consult the Mindgem about the Makers, their arts, or their history, ask a question and roll +INT: on a 7+, it answers but on a 10+, pick 1; on a 7-9, pick 2:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The answer is cryptic, vague, or lacking crucial context</li>

    <li>It takes a long time&mdash;hours or even days&mdash;to get the answer</li>

</ul>

    <li>It wastes your time with irrelevant histories and data</li>

    <li>It answers now, but refuses to answer further questions until you make progress 
        towards restoring its body (or, if its body is assembled, until you pay its Cost).</li>
</ul>
