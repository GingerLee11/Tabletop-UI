<p>When you <em><strong>spend a day preparing the special ingredients</strong></em> 
    (Value 1) <em><strong>according to the secret recipe</strong></em>, 
    you create a ◇ jar of magic butter (⭘⭘⭘⭘⭘ hours).
</p>

<p>When you <em><strong>light the lamp using the magic butter and intone the mantra</strong></em>,
    the lamp gives off a pale, heatless light so long as you continue to chant. 
    Within this light:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Active spirits are visible, even if they are not manifest</li>
    <li>Illusions, glamours, and veils are stripped away</li>
    <li>Shapechangers can be seen for what theu truly are</li>
    <li>Hidden things radiate a bright aura</li>
    <li>Lies spoken are visble as black smoke that lingers near the ground</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Alas, the light draws the ire of any wraiths (or other hungry undead spirits) nearby.
