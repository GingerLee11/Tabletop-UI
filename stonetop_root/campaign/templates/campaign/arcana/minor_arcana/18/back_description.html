<p>When you <em><strong>crush the life from the Nerth Serpent and devour its still warm heart</strong></em>, hold 3 Vitality. While you hold Vitality, you age very slowly.</p>

<p>Spend Vitality 1-for-1 to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Shrug off a poison, sickness, or curse</li>

    <li>Survive a lethal wound or injury</li>

    <li>Recover fully from a permanent injury or impairment (with a few days&rsquo; rest)</li>

    <li>Perform a feat of extraordinary strength, prowess, or endurance</li>
</ul>

<p>Each time you spend Vitality, you manifest a permanent mark of the wild (antlers, hide-like skin, animal eyes, etc.) or such a mark becomes more pronounced. Tell us what it is.</p>
