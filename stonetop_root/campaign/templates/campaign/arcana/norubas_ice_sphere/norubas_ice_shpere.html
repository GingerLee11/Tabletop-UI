<p>
    When you <em><strong>peer into the Ice-Sphere</strong></em>, 
    your mind is cleared of strong emotions. 
    When you <em><strong>gaze deeply into the Ice-Sphere and ponder a situation, puzzle, or mystery</strong></em>, ask the GM one of the questions below. 
    The GM will answer honestly
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Who benfits (or would benefit) from ___?</li>
    <li>What about ____ isn't what it seems to be?</li>
    <li>How could I learn more about ____ ?</li>
    <li>What's the most likely outcome if ____ ?</li>
    <li>What am I overlooking?</li>
</ul>

<p>
    After the GM answers, roll +INT: <strong>on a 10+</strong>, hold 2 Acumen; <strong>on a 7-9</strong>, hold 1. 
    While acting on the GM&rsquo;s answer, you can spend Acumen 1-for-1 to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ask another question from the list above, and get an honest answer</li>
    <li>Treat a 6- that you rolled as a 7-9, or a 7-9 as a 10+</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>On a 6-</strong>, your connection to your body weakens&mdash;mark a debility and mark 1 circle. 
    The debility lasts until you spend a few days living wholly in your body and averting your gaze from the Ice-Sphere.
