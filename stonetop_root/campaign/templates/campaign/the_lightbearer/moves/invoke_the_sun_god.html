<p>When you imbue a holy light with Helior's power,
    choose an Invocation you know and roll +WIS: on
    a 10+, it works as described but you must choose 1
    consequence from the list below; on a 7-9, it works
    as described, but you and the GM each choose 1.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The invocation has its <em>reduced</em> effect</li>
    <li>The effort taxes you; mark a debility</li>
    <li>The light is snuffed out when the Invocation is complete, its fuel consumed</li>
    <li>You must bask in the sunlight for an hour or so before using that Invocation again</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <strong>Invocation</strong> page for details.</p>
