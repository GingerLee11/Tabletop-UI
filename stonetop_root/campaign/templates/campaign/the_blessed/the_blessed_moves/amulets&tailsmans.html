    When you <strong><em>craft a protective charm for someone</strong></em>,
    spend 1 Stock and name a source of harm (fire,
    stabbing, etc.). When they <strong><em>would suffer such harm
    while bearing your charm</strong></em>, roll +INT: <strong>on a 10+</strong>, they
    ignore the harm entirely; <strong>on a 7-9</strong>, they suffer only
    half the damage or effect; <strong>on a 6-</strong>, they suffer the
    harm normally. One can benefit from only 1 charm
    at a time, and it loses its potency after 1 use.
