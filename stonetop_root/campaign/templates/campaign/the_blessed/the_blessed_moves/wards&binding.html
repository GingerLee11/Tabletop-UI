<p>When you <em><strong>mark a boundary with sacred signs</strong></em>, spend 1 Stock and describe who or what they affect (using no more words than your level). Also, choose whether the affected beings are repelled or trapped by the signs.</p>

<p>When <em><strong>your wards or bindings are first tested</strong></em>, roll +INT: <strong>on 10+</strong>, they will hold as long as the signs remain unmarred (and the affected creature can do nothing to affect them directly); <strong>on a 7-9</strong>, they hold for now but may be overcome through might or will.</p>
