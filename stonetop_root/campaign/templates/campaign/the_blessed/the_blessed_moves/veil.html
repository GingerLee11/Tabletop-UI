    When you <strong><em>wrap yourself or another in a subtle veil</em></strong>,
    spend 1 Stock and choose 1:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A type of being you name (including “people”)
        will tend to ignore your presence
    </li>
    <li>People will perceive you as someone else,
        though you must wear something of an
        individual’s in order to impersonate them
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When <strong><em>your deception comes under scrutiny</em></strong>, roll
    +INT: <strong>on a 10+</strong>, the veil holds, and no one is the
    wiser;<strong> on a 7-9</strong>, the veil holds, but there is further
    scrutiny or a complication (GM’s choice).
