<p>When <em><strong>Seasons Change and you oversee the sacred 
    rites</strong></em>, you can sacrifice 2 Surplus to increase the
    steading&rsquo;s Fortunes by 1 (max +3). If you sacrifice 
    something (or someone) much-loved and greatly valued, 
    you can redo a roll from Seasons Change, 
    with your choice of advantage or disadvantage.
