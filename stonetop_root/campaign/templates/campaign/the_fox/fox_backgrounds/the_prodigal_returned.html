<p>You left long ago, travelling far and living by your
    wits. Why did you leave? What deeds do you boast
    of, and which do you regret?
    You always longed to return to Stonetop, and return
    you have. You're a bit of a celebrity now, and you've
    got friends (or close enough) strewn about the
    known world.
    When you declare that you know someone outside of
    Stonetop, someone who can help, name them and
    roll +CHA: on a 10+, yeah, they can help (tell us
    why they're willing); on a 7-9, they can help but
    pick 1 from the list below; on a 6-, the GM chooses
    1 and then some.

<ul>
    <li>They still hold a grudge</li>
    <li>They're going to need something from you first</li>
    <li>They swore off this sort of thing long ago</li>
    <li>You can't exactly y'know trust them</li>
</ul>
