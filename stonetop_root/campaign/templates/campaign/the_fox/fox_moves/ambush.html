<p>When you attack someone up close and they don't see
    it coming, deal your damage or roll +DEX: on a 10+,
    deal your damage and pick 2; on a 7-9, deal your
    damage and pick 1.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Deal +1d4 damage</li>
    <li>Stop them from making noise/raising an alarm</li>
    <li>Slip away before they can react</li>
    <li>Create an opportunity; you or an ally gains 
        advantage on the next move to act on it
    </li>
</ul>
