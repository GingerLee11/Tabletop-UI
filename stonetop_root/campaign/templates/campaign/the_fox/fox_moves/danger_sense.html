<p>You can always ask the GM, “Is there an ambush or
    trap here?” If they say “yes,” roll +INT: on a 10+, ask
    the GM both of the questions below; on a 7-9, ask
    1; either way, gain advantage on your next roll to
    act on the answer(s).
</p>
<ul>
    <li>What will trigger the ambush or trap?</li>
    <li>What will happen once it's triggered?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On a 6-</strong>, don't mark XP; you know there's a trap or
    ambush, but nothing bad happens just yet. </p>
