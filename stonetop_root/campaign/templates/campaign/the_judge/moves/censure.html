    When you first denounce someone (or thing) as an
    agent of chaos or anathema to civilization, pick 1:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>You/your allies deal +1 damage against them</li>
    <li>They deal -1 damage</li>
    <li>They recoil and might be momentarily stunned</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The bonus/penalty ends if you use this move again.
