            <p>Your sacred pouch (magical) doesn't take up space
                in your inventory. It can hold up to 3 Stock (sacred
                herbs, powders, stones, pigments, chalks, clay, and
                so forth). Each time you gain an even-numbered
                level, your pouch can hold +1 Stock. When <strong>anyone
                but you looks inside your sacred pouch and touches the
                materials therein</strong>, the Stock is ruined.
                When you <strong>have a few days of downtime in familiar
                terrain</strong>, you may replenish your Stock.
                When you <strong>Forage</strong>, you can produce Stock instead
                of provisions.
