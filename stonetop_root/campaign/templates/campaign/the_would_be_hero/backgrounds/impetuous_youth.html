<p>Stonetop has always been home, but you chafe at the demands of mundane life and have always longed for more. Excitement! Danger! When you make a move and come up short, you can give it your all and turn a 6- into a 7-9, a 7-9 into a 10+, and (if it matters), a 10-11 into a 12+. But if you do, pick 1 (the GM will fi ll in the details):</p>

<ul>
    <li>You get hurt (2d4 damage and an actual injury)</li>

    <li>You cause collateral damage, endanger others, or otherwise escalate the situation</li>

    <li>Something on your person is lost or breaks</li>
</ul>
